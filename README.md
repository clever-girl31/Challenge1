# Challenge 1

## Description

The resulting application created in this project:
- Uses semantic HTML elements which follow a logical structure within the source code.
- Utilizes alt attributes for all of its image files.
- Contains heading attributes that fall in sequential order and function as navigation links within the page.
- Has a unique title.
- Has a more concise CSS stylesheet, with annotations.

This project was undertaken in order to improve accessibility and in turn allow the application to serve a more expanded variety of users.

In completing this project, I learned the importance of categorizing and naming elements in a logical way in order to avoid having a cluttered style sheet with lines of repetitive code. I also gained more experience manipulating existing HTML and CSS code.
